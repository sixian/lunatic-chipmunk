With Lunatic Chipmunk you can use [chipmunk physics](https://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-physics/) trough lua code. Is well known that a scripting language is used as glue code with fast modules written in C/C++ o rapid prototyping. This module let you use 2d physics with garbage collection with a pseudo OO interface.
